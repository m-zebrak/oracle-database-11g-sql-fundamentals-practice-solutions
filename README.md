## Practice 1

### Part 1

1. The following ***SELECT*** statement executes successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          job_id,
          salary AS Sal
   FROM employees;
   ```
   **Answer:** True


2. The following ***SELECT*** statement executes successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM job_grades;
   ```
   **Answer:** True

3. There are four coding errors in this statement. Can you identify them?
   > 1. there is no column 'sal' in the employees table.
   > 2. 'x' cannot be used as multiplication operator, use '*' instead.
   > 3. if column alias contains spaces you must put it in quotation marks.
   > 4. a comma is missing after the last_name column.

### Part 2

4. Your first task is to determine the ***DEPARTMENTS*** structure of the table and its contents.
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE departments;
   SELECT *
   FROM departments;
   ```

5. You need to determine the structure of the ***EMPLOYEES*** table.
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE employees;
   ```

6. Test your query in the ***lab_01_05.sql*** file to ensure that it runs correctly.
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id,
          last_name,
          job_id,
          hire_date startdate
   FROM employees;
   ```

7. The HR department wants a query to display all unique job IDs from the ***EMPLOYEES*** table.
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT job_id
   FROM employees;   
   ```

8. The HR department wants more descriptive column headings for its report on employees. Copy the statement from ***
   lab_01_05.sql*** to a new SQL Worksheet. Name the column headings ***Emp#***, ***Employee***, ***Job*** and ***Hire
   Date*** respectively. Then run your query again.
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id "Emp #",
          last_name   "Employee",
          job_id      "Job",
          hire_date   "Hire Date"
   FROM employees;
   ```

9. The HR department has requested a report of all employees and their job IDs. Display the last name concatenated with
   the job ID (separated by a comma and space) and name the column ***Employee and Title***.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name ||
          ', ' || job_id "Employee and Title"
   FROM employees;
   ```

10. To familiarize yourself with the data in the ***EMPLOYEES*** table, create a query to display all the data from
    the ***EMPLOYEES*** table. Separate each column output with a comma. Name the column as ***THE_OUTPUT***.
    ```sql
    SELECT employee_id ||
           ',' ||
           first_name ||
           ',' ||
           last_name ||
           ',' ||
           email ||
           ',' ||
           phone_number ||
           ',' ||
           job_id ||
           ',' ||
           manager_id ||
           ',' ||
           hire_date ||
           ',' ||
           commission_pct ||
           ',' ||
           department_id the_output
    FROM employees;
    ```

## Practice 2

1. Because of budget issues, the HR department needs a report that displays the last name and salary of employees who
   earn more than $12,000. Save your SQL statement as a file named
   ***lab_02_01.sql***. Run your query.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary > 12000;
   ```


2. Open a new SQL Worksheet. Create a report that displays the last name and department number for employee number 176.
   Run the query.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          department_id
   FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 176;
   ```

3. The HR department needs to find high-salary and low-salary employees. Modify ***lab_02_01.sql*** to display the last
   name and salary for any employee whose salary is not in the range of $5,000 to $12,000. Save your SQL statement
   as ***lab_02_03.sql***.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name, 
          salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 5000 AND 12000;
   ```

4. Create a report to display the last name, job ID, and hire date for employees with the last names of Matos and
   Taylor. Order the query in ascending order by the hire date.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          job_id,
          hire_date
   FROM employees
   WHERE last_name IN ('Matos', 'Taylor')
   ORDER BY hire_date;
   ```

5. Display the last name and department ID of all employees in departments 20 or 50 in ascending alphabetical order by
   name.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          department_id
   FROM employees
   WHERE department_id IN (20, 50)
   ORDER BY last_name;
   ```

6. Modify ***lab_02_03.sql*** to display the last name and salary of employees who earn between $5,000 and $12,000, and
   are in department 20 or 50. Label the columns ***Employee*** and
   ***Monthly Salary***, respectively. Resave ***lab_02_03.sql*** as ***lab_02_06.sql***. Run the statement in ***
   lab_02_06.sql***
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name "Employee",
          salary    "Monthly Salary"
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 12000
   AND department_id IN (20, 50)
   ORDER BY last_name;
   ```

7. The HR department needs a report that displays the last name and hire date for all employees who were hired in 1994.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          hire_date
   FROM employees
   WHERE hire_date LIKE '94%';
   ```

8. Create a report to display the last name and job title of all employees who do not have a manager.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          job_id
   FROM employees
   WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
   ```

9. Create a report to display the last name, salary, and commission of all employees who earn commissions. Sort data in
   descending order of salary and commissions. Use the column's numeric position in the ***ORDER BY*** clause.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          salary,
          commission_pct
   FROM employees
   WHERE commission_pct IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY 2 DESC, 3 DESC;
   ```

10. Members of the HR department want to have more flexibility with the queries that you are writing. They would like a
    report that displays the last name and salary of employees who earn more than an amount that the user specifies
    after a prompt. Save this query to a file named ***lab_02_10.sql***. If you enter ***12000*** when prompted, the
    report displays the following results:
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary > &salary;
   ```

11. The HR department wants to run reports based on a manager. Create a query that prompts the user for a manager ID and
    generates the employee ID, last name, salary, and department for that manager's employees. The HR department wants
    the ability to sort the report on a selected column. You can test the data with the following values:
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id,
          last_name,
          salary,
          department_id
   FROM employees
   WHERE manager_id = &manager_id
   ORDER BY &order_col;
   ```

12. Display all employee last names in which the third letter of the name is "a".
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name
   FROM employees
   WHERE last_name LIKE '__a%';
   ```

13. Display the last names of all employees who have both an "a" and an "e" in their last name.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name
   FROM employees
   WHERE last_name LIKE '%a%'
     AND last_name LIKE '%e%';
   ```

14. Display the last name, job, and salary for all employees whose jobs are either those of a sales representative or of
    a stock clerk, and whose salaries are not equal to $2,500, $3,500, or $7,000.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          job_id,
          salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE job_id IN ('SA_REP', 'ST_CLERK')
     AND salary NOT IN (2500, 3500, 7000);
   ```

15. Modify  ***lab_02_06.sql*** to display the last name, salary, and commission for all employees whose commission is
    20%. Resave ***lab_02_06.sql*** as ***lab_02_15.sql***. Rerun the statement in ***lab_02_15.sql***.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name "Employee",
          salary    "Monthly Salary",
          commission_pct
   FROM employees
   WHERE commission_pct = .2;
   ```
