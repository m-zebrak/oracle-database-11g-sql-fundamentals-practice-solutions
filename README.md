## Practice 1

### Part 1

1. The following ***SELECT*** statement executes successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          job_id,
          salary AS Sal
   FROM employees;
   ```
   **Answer:** True


2. The following ***SELECT*** statement executes successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM job_grades;
   ```
   **Answer:** True

3. There are four coding errors in this statement. Can you identify them?
   > 1. there is no column 'sal' in the employees table.
   > 2. 'x' cannot be used as multiplication operator, use '*' instead.
   > 3. if column alias contains spaces you must put it in quotation marks.
   > 4. a comma is missing after the last_name column.

### Part 2

4. Your first task is to determine the ***DEPARTMENTS*** structure of the table and its contents.
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE departments;
   SELECT *
   FROM departments;
   ```

5. You need to determine the structure of the ***EMPLOYEES*** table.
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE employees;
   ```

6. Test your query in the ***lab_01_05.sql*** file to ensure that it runs correctly.
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id,
          last_name,
          job_id,
          hire_date startdate
   FROM employees;
   ```

7. The HR department wants a query to display all unique job IDs from the ***EMPLOYEES*** table.
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT job_id
   FROM employees;   
   ```

8. The HR department wants more descriptive column headings for its report on employees. Copy the statement from ***
   lab_01_05.sql*** to a new SQL Worksheet. Name the column headings ***Emp#***, ***Employee***, ***Job*** and ***Hire
   Date*** respectively. Then run your query again.
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id "Emp #",
          last_name   "Employee",
          job_id      "Job",
          hire_date   "Hire Date"
   FROM employees;
   ```

9. The HR department has requested a report of all employees and their job IDs. Display the last name concatenated with
   the job ID (separated by a comma and space) and name the column ***Employee and Title***.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name ||
          ', ' || job_id "Employee and Title"
   FROM employees;
   ```

10. To familiarize yourself with the data in the ***EMPLOYEES*** table, create a query to display all the data from
    the ***EMPLOYEES*** table. Separate each column output with a comma. Name the column as ***THE_OUTPUT***.
   ```sql
   SELECT employee_id ||
          ',' ||
          first_name ||
          ',' ||
          last_name ||
          ',' ||
          email ||
          ',' ||
          phone_number ||
          ',' ||
          job_id ||
          ',' ||
          manager_id ||
          ',' ||
          hire_date ||
          ',' ||
          commission_pct ||
          ',' ||
          department_id the_output
   FROM employees;
   ```

## Practice 2

1. Because of budget issues, the HR department needs a report that displays the last name and salary of employees who
   earn more than $12,000. Save your SQL statement as a file named
   ***lab_02_01.sql***. Run your query.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary > 12000;
   ```


2. Open a new SQL Worksheet. Create a report that displays the last name and department number for employee number 176.
   Run the query.
    ```sql
   SELECT last_name,
          department_id
   FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 176;
   ```

3. The HR department needs to find high-salary and low-salary employees. Modify ***lab_02_01.sql*** to display the last
   name and salary for any employee whose salary is not in the range of $5,000 to $12,000. Save your SQL statement
   as ***lab_02_03.sql***.
   ```sql
   SELECT last_name, 
          salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 5000 AND 12000;
   ```
